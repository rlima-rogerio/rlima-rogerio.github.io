This is a list of voluteer workshops in embedded systems using the Arduino platform as showcases with applications, code explanation, and real-world examples.

2019/S2 - Undergraduate Courses Fair and Exhibition
====
This one-day workshop consisted of a quick and introductory explanation (~5 min) about embedded systems focused on the Arduino platform. The audience consisted of individuals aiming to enroll in Undergraduate courses. Several Arduino development kits were prepared to run code applications so the prospective students could interact with the kits. 


2018/S2 - Workshop
====
This single-day workshop consisted of a 45 min talk about an overview of embedded systems focused on Arduino, fundamentals of C/C++ programming language, data types, functions, conditional and logic statements, examples, and applications. The audience consisted of 50+ undergrad students of all Engineering courses, but mostly from Electrical Engineering. 

2017/S2 - Workshop
====
This one-day workshop consisted of a quick and introductory explanation (~5 min) about embedded systems focused on the Arduino platform. The audience consisted of several small groups of senior high school students from all over the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte (Brazil) aiming to enroll in Undergraduate courses. Several Arduino development kits were prepared to run code applications so the students could interact with the kits (pushing buttons to turn on/off LEDs and buzzers, turning knobs to change LED colors, etc.).
